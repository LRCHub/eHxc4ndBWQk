[00:01.77] The same stars as that day We
[00:05.95] As a landmark, we layered our voices
[00:11.45] 
[00:31.36] The longing that surfaced And the regret that had deeply seeped in
[00:35.66] If only I could speak freely as myself, how much easier it would be.
[00:41.55] Hey, what kind of sound should I use to make my dreams ring?
[00:45.46] I knew it all along. It was me who was standing still.
[00:57.96] Words that slipped out without a second thought
[00:50.22] I couldn't take good care of you.
[00:57.29] 
[01:01.13] Even if you turn a blind eye
[01:03.05] I'm still here, you know
[01:05.94] Hey, you're yelling!
[01:09.44] 
[01:09.58] Why am I laughing? Not a single thing.
[01:13.13] Even though I can't put into words What I want to say
[01:16.32] (I want to change, I want to move forward) I realized it.
[01:20.14] Carried by the sound, A single ray of light flows onward
[01:24.40] We can do it too (It's okay, let's move forward)
[01:28.28] Tell them now
[01:41.97] Can you hear me? This voice
[01:47.47] 
[01:56.52] Layers upon layers of projection Clumsy, distorted defenses too
[02:00.53] If I could just be myself, how much easier it would be.
[02:06.52] Hey, what kind of poem should I use to expose myself?
[02:10.42] The one who was all alone, holding back tears—that was the me of the past.
[02:19.92] The crumbling, worthless pride
[02:15.50] 
[02:22.21] I couldn't wait to run away.
[02:26.03] I'm just here beside you I believe in you, see?
[02:30.87] I can hear you. Hey.
[02:35.37] Why am I hesitating? Not a single thing.
[02:34.55] 
[02:37.72] You don't have any feelings that could be discarded, do you?
[02:41.62] (I want to fulfill it, I want to deliver it) I'll carry it with me
[02:45.28] Set to song, A sound that races across the world
[02:49.49] Can we do it too? (It's okay, let's move forward)
[02:53.60] I'm going up
[02:57.10] 
[03:15.23] We
[03:16.46] We laughed together until the sun set We raced through the night to see the stars
[03:21.56] I didn't care about the future. That feeling.
[03:26.19] Don't forget I won't forget Forever
[03:33.69] 
[03:35.12] Things that change Things that pass
[03:38.18] No one can stop it.
[03:43.18] I can't do it.
[03:45.26] Living in this moment
[03:48.23] Because I want to find the "now" that can't be missed
[03:52.23] I'm here.
[03:55.73] I want to make this song resonate
[03:55.14] 
[03:58.17] If someone is waiting there
[04:01.45] (Let's play it, let's share it)
[04:03.49] In the world I was born into
[04:05.28] Carried on the voice, dark night
[04:08.43] Even if we're still weak in the sky
[04:11.76] Because it shines, I must tell you now.
[04:17.76] 
[04:39.60] Can you hear me? This voice
